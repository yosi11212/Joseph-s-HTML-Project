  <h1>About This American Roulette Website</h1>

  <p>This website is my final project for my high school computer science class, representing 30% of my final grade! I decided to create a resource about American Roulette after a memorable trip to Prague with my friends.</p>

  <p>While exploring the city, my friend Roei and I stumbled upon a casino. Intrigued, we decided to try our luck at American Roulette.  We started with a small bet and, to our surprise, ended up multiplying our money several times over!  This exciting experience sparked my curiosity about the game and how it works.</p>

  <p>This website is the result of my newfound interest in American Roulette. Here, I aim to provide a comprehensive guide for anyone curious about the game, from the basics of gameplay and betting options to strategies and the house edge. Whether you're a seasoned gambler or a complete beginner, I hope this website serves as a valuable resource and enhances your understanding of American Roulette.</p>
